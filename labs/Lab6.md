# Lab 6 - CNN

### Instructions
You should work with your partner, but you should have your own copy of work that was generated with your own hands (i.e., this is not pair programming).

With a partner and in colab (AND without Googling a solution), can you create a CNN using Pytorch that beats my relatively simple network?

To make this fun and worth while, I’m going to put down some rules:
1. You are not allowed to Google solutions (only documentation). You should only have three tabs open. One is for Colab and the other two are for the links below.
2. You can use official documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html 
3. Don’t Google solutions! What is the point if you just look up the answer?!
4. At the end of lab, upload a PDF of your notebook.
