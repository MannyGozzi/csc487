# Lab 7 - Catch up lab

### Instructions
For this lab, I want you to work on either the standardized assignments or mastery assignments. Depending on whether you are at in the class. If you are done with all of these, then your task is to help others (not giving them the answers of course ;). Everyone must create a PDF documenting their work effort. It should have the following sections and be uploaded as a PDF:

The plan: What activities are you going to focus on during lab? How are you going to spend your time?

Notes: Make notes about what you are learning. Not just what you are completing. This isn't a checklist. It's a history of time well spent no matter the output.

Reflection: How did it go? What would you do differently? What worked out well and you would do the same?
